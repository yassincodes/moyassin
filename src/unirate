this was my first coding project. it took like over a month to finish

the computer i used was borrowed from a friend of mine and i was building it on the cheapest stack ever imagined

i was in control repeating some exams, btw they closed the doors of uni on me forgetting that i was there hahahahahaha.

that part of the reason i wanted to be out of uni hahahaha

github was not known to me back then. i say so cause after the website was a hit, my computer was broke lol. stoped working on the project when my computer was broken 

at the same days, i got my second failure in uni (i was about to droupout anyway)

10 days later, after i was packing my clothes leaving home with no plan at all,

i got the news that it appeared they made a mistake and i succeed that year (dont know how)

the project performed well and was used by and loved by thousands of students in tunisia

i dont work on the idea now but i might get back to it one day (i guess im changing the name next time haha) instead on a different kind of project with the same concept

comerate.me, same as ratethefuck, but instead it is about you

anyway i only have access to the first tiktok video i used to launch the project

(tiktok)

and and old facebook account i built just to share it!

(facebook link)

the project helped me basically learn everything about coding,

later on, i build other projects with the same code (just clones of other websites)

wich got me multiple freelance positions
